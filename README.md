These programs were written for an introductory C++ programming course. All three games use conio.h, so can only be run on Windows.

GCC is required to compile them. I used MinGW - Minimalist GNU for Windows (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

Instructions for compiling and running, for example, Hangman from CMD:

1. Navigate to the folder containing the .cpp file
2. Compile using the following command:
   g++ Hangman.cpp -o Hangman
4. Run using the following command:
   Hangman
