These programs were written for an introductory C++ programming course. All three games can only be compiled and run on Windows.

GCC is required to compile them. I used MinGW - Minimalist GNU for Windows (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).

Instructions for compiling and running, for example, TicTacToe from CMD:

1. Navigate to the folder containing the .cpp file
2. Compile:
   g++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
4. Run:
   tictactoe
